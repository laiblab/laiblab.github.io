# Lai Lab @ PKU Website

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Stephan Sanders](https://sanderslab.github.io/). We greatly thank for Allan and Stephan for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://laiblab.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/laiblab). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Drummond lab and Sanders lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
