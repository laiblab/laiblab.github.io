- title: "Transcription factors TCF-1 and GATA3 are key factors for the epigenetic priming of early innate lymphoid progenitors toward distinct cell fates"
  image: EILP-ILC-priming.png
  description: Using multiple advanced epigenomic sequencing technologies, we report the celular heterogeneity on epigenome in early innate lymphoid progenitors which affects the downstream lineage differentiation. We show how key transcription factor TCF1 regulate the epigenomic heterogeneity and differentiation towards ILC progenitors.

- title: "Principles of nucleosome organization revealed by single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing"
  image: nucleosome_organization.jpg
  description: We report a technique, termed single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing (scMNase-seq) that can be used to simultaneously measure genome-wide nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility in single cells. We reveal novel principles of nucleosome organization related to chromatin activity and report the existence of cells primed for differentiation to specific lineages in undifferentiated cell populations.

  image: Trac-looping.png
  description: We report transposase-mediated analysis of chromatin looping (Trac-looping) for simultaneous detection of multiscale genome-wide chromatin interactions among regulatory elements and chromatin accessibility. Application of Trac-looping to human CD4+ T cells revealed substantial reorganization of enhancer-promoter interactions associated with changes in gene expression after T cell receptor stimulation.
