# Open positions

　**Our lab aims to understand the principles and mechanisms underlying the cell fate generation, maintenance and transition. We use multi-omics approaches to answer varied questions related to cell fate. Specifically, we develop both experimental and computational methods for high-throughput sequencing techniques to extend our knowledge about cell fates and to reveal novel insights into development, ageing and disease. We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!**

### Postdoc positions:
　Postdoc positions are open for both dry- and wet-lab directions. An ideal candidate in bioinformatics should have (or about to have) a PhD in computational biology/genomics/bioinformatics/computer science/statistics or another quantitative field, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable. Those with an outstanding record in a quantitative field without significant exposure to biology may also be considered.

　A candidate in experimental biology should have (or about to have) a PhD in molecular/cellular biology/immunity/cancer or other biological fields. Candidates with a Ph. D. degree in biology with substantial wet-lab experience are very welcomed to apply.

　We aim at building a supportive and productive team. Successful candidates will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of genomics, epigenetics, development and cancers. Applicants for other relevant projects and programs will be encouraged and supported. 

　If you are interested in joining us, please send me an [email](mailto:laib@bjmu.edu.cn) along with a brief cover letter, a detailed CV and at least two recommendation letters. Please indicate "Application Postdoc (Your name)" in the email subject. You can find the current job posting here with detailed compensation and benefits:
